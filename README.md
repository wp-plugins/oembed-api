Make WordPress an oEmbed provider.

This feature plugin leverages the new REST API to make WordPress an oEmbed provider. It aims to be compliant with the JSON specification at oEmbed.com. See WordPress Core ticket [\#32522](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32522).

**Note:** WordPress 4.3 Beta 3 or later and version 2 of the REST API are required to run this plugin.
